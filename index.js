  TASK 1
    - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
    - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

  TASK 2

        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. Explicit Binding: 
    a. .call(): immediately invokes a function, we pass in argyments 1 by 1
    b. .apply(): invokes function immediately, we pass in arguemnts as an array
    c. .bind(): pass in arguments 1 by 1 but it does not immediately invoke the function, but returns a brand new function that can be invoked later
  2. Implcit Binding: applies to objects with methods, when the function is invoked, look to the left of the dot, that's what "this" refers to
  3. Window Binding: if we don't give this any context it will return the window/ the global object in node and it will return undefined in strict mode
  4. New Binding: using the new keyword constructs a new object and 'this' points to it. When a function is invoked as a constructor function, using the 'new' keyword 'this' points to the new object that's created
